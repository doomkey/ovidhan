2. Learning & Engagement

These settings enhance the educational aspects of the app.

    Word of the Day Notifications:

        What it does: Allows the user to enable a daily push notification that shows them the Word of the Day at a time they choose.

        Implementation: This is a more advanced feature that would require a Capacitor plugin for local notifications (@capacitor/local-notifications). You'd let the user pick a time, and then schedule a recurring daily notification.

    "Show Pronunciation" Toggle:

        What it does: A simple toggle to show or hide the phonetic pronunciation text (/ˈkarē/) on the detail and Word of the Day pages. Some users may not need it and might prefer a cleaner interface.

        Implementation: A simple composable that stores a boolean value, which you would check with a v-if in the relevant components.

3. Data Management

These settings give users control over their data stored in the app.

    Clear All Recent Searches:

        What it does: A button that clears the entire recent search history. This is a good privacy feature.

        Implementation: You already have the clearRecents function in your useRecents composable. You just need to add a button on the settings page that calls it (likely after a confirmation dialog).

    Clear All Favorites:

        What it does: A button to remove all saved favorite words at once.

        Implementation: Similar to clearing recents, you would add a clearFavorites function to your useFavorites composable and call it from a button on this page.

4. General & About

These are standard items found in most applications.

    Rate This App:

        What it does: A button that links directly to your app's page on the App Store or Google Play Store.

        Implementation: Uses Capacitor's Browser plugin or a simple link.

    Share This App:

        What it does: Opens the native device sharing menu to let the user send a link to your app to their friends.

        Implementation: Uses Capacitor's Share plugin.

    About Page:

        What it does: A separate page that shows the app version, credits for the dictionary data, and links to your privacy policy or terms of service.
